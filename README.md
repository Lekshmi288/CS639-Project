Project title: Bayesian vs Frequentist Approach in Medical Research

Project partner: Harsh Sahu

In medical research, statistical methods are commonly used to analyze data and draw conclu-
sions. Two common approaches are the Bayesian and frequentist approaches. In simple words,
Bayesian statistics involves the use of past/existing knowledge (a.k.a prior) along with the new
data to make predictions, while frequentist statistics involves making inferences based on the
observed data alone. We start this review with a short overview of each approach followed by
the application of Bayesian and frequentist methods in predicting the risk of dementia in older
adults. We then attempt to do a comparison study.
